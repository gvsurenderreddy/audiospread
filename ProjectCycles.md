This wiki presents the way that our project should advance.
# Introduction #

Each developer of each team: Drupal and Asterisk should see the project as a number of tasks
which have to correspond to **users stories**.

For example:
"as a [role](some.md), I want to [some simple action](do.md)"

Each user story corresponds to one or several **developing tasks**.

Finally, each task has a **developing period**(hours).

**Bugs** can occur and must be resolved in an estimated number of hours.





# Cycle #

**Iterations of 10 days with the available number of workable hours according to our schedule.**

**A number of developers is assigned to this iteration**-> see tickets sent by each of the two teams managers (Wenyi: Drupal; me: Asterisk)to their developers.


**Inserting in each iteration user storie's tasks or bugs to resolve.**
