  * Roadmap has some first steps/tickets for development that can be started.
  * Everyone knows how to work with:
    * the roadmap which contains tasks for a long time,
    * svn update, commit, conflicts, (branch & tags,)
    * code reviews & requests for reviews (while commit messages). See [http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/CodeReviews here].
    * SSH tunneling through ECE's gandalf
  * Testing team and other development teams are ready (sip+softphone/drupal account created).
  * Rational Unified Process & Agile Development methodologies have been reconciled and formalised, making the whole aware of those and how they are to be applied during the project.
