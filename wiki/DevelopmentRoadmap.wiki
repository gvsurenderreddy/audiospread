== 0.05 Base server stacks deployed & working ==
Write manuals for the following steps ?
On our main server at rue de Grenelle (JBTV):
  * ~~LAMP stack installed (Ubuntu)~~ *DONE*
  * network-specific requests made to ECE admin:
    * we have our own Ethernet plug hole & fixed IP
    * Internews has a custom ECE unix account (can be delayed...)
    * SSH possible from within local area network 
    * SSH possible from outside 
  * user accounts = same accounts used for committing 
  * Drupal installed 
  * Asterisk installed 
  * SVN is working from-to sourceforge repository from within ECE 
  * Asterisk can be called from local area network and from outside with a softphone 

----

== 0.1 Install is ready for development ==
  * Drupal & Asterisk's seperate folders for modules created 
  * The latter folders are versioned properly
  * Auto-mirroring of svn code to Google Code is setup with svn hooks
  * Everyone knows how to work with:
    * the roadmap,
    * svn update, commit, conflicts, branch & tags,
    * code reviews & requests for reviews (while commit messages). See [http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/CodeReviews here].
    * SSH tunneling through ECE's gandalf
  * Testing team and other development teams are ready.
  * Branches are created for first drafting of modules ? (maybe unneeded...)
  * Rational Unified Process & Agile Development methodologies have been reconciled and formalised, making the whole aware of those and how they are to be applied during the project.
  * Roadmap has some first steps/tickets for development that can be started.
