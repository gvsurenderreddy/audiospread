= Extending Asterisk and Drupal =

Some info on extending Asterisk and Drupal functionalities by creating modules and such.

= Extending Drupal =

== Installing new modules ==

Drupal modules usually ship as a tar.gz archive which we have to extract to the drupal's /modules/ folder (for example: /var/www/drupal/modules). After extraction, go to the drupal administration interface (log in as an administrator user and go to Administer), go to Site building then Modules and chose to "run cron manually" if necessary or just observe that new modules have been installed.

For each module, we can enable or disable features by ticking checkboxes. Although, some features require other modules to be installed first. This is the case of the 

== Installing the File Framework and getting its File Browser up ==

The *fileframework module* can be downloaded from [http://drupal.org/project/fileframework/ this page]. Download the latest/available version, it should be ok.

In order to have the file browser up, we need to:
  # install the *[http://drupal.org/project/rdf/ RDF module]* and the *[http://drupal.org/project/bitcache Bitcache module]* (Important, *don't download alpha-3 see (1)* !).
  # in Drupal's interface, log in as an administrator go to Administer > Site building > Modules > File management: *enable the "Browser" feature*.

(1) Either download the alpha2 version (from december 2008) or the last development version (from 14 january 2009 or later), but not alpha-3 which is buggy and won't allow you to create any new piece of content ! Use [http://drupal.org/node/192590/release this link to be able to download more versions] of the Bitcache module.

== Adding new sounds to Asterisk ==
On [http://encyclopedia.wordpress.com/2007/09/25/asterisk-writing-native-extensions-for-asterisk-12/ this encyclopedia page], Justin Tunney says:
"The core encoding method for Asterisk is AST_FORMAT_SLINEAR, in which non-compressed audio is sampled 8000 times a second, with 16-bit signed samples." (those files in .sln extension)

For conversion into .gsm (natively accepted by Asterisk): once you have some files to convert, you should follow the tutorial at [http://www.voip-info.org/tiki-index.php?page=Convert+WAV+audio+files+for+use+in+Asterisk this page] to do roughly the following things:
  # Convert your sound files to .gsm or .sln file format using sox or whatever software application you want.(1)
  # Move your files to /usr/share/asterisk/sounds/ (and inside another folder of your choice if you want).
  # In extensions.conf (from /etc/asterisk/) you Playback() and !BackGround() calls should refer to your file name's path relative to /usr/share/asterisk/sounds/ and without any extension (no .gsm or .wav if ever you manage to make .wav played).

(1) note: If you use sox, the `sox source.wav dest.gsm` command without more options may not be sufficient to give the right results because the sampling rate is obviously unchanged between source and destination. If that sampling rate is too high, Asterisk will play the gsm at less than the speed you want.

== Coding new functions to be used in the dialplan ==
_All quoted stuff comes from [http://encyclopedia.wordpress.com/2007/09/25/asterisk-writing-native-extensions-for-asterisk-12/ this page] written by Justin Tunney._
"The following directories in the Asterisk source tree are important and worth mentioning."

  * "funcs/ Where custom dial plan function modules are stored. Custom functions are registered with ast_custom_function_register()."
