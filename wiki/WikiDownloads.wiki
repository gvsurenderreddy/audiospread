_*This cross-platform tool creates multiple tunnels/channels towards a single destination through an SSH tunnel to a single gate.*_

We use it in house to tunnel connections to MySQL, HTTP, (SVN+)SSH/SFTP, SIP daemons through our university gateway towards a LAMPA (last A is for Asterisk) server behind that gateway. It does the work expected for the tunneling boxes drawn on [http://audiospread.googlecode.com/files/DevelopmentWorkDeployment.png this project development diagram].

An external JSON file is used to setup of the gate host's hostname and port, destination host's hostname, and correspondance between ports to open locally and ports to reach on destination host.

To skip having to share a login & password, or to type the latters at each run:
  # a module named provided_login_info.py containing string variables username and password can be put in the same folder as the executable so as to make the latter detect and use it.
  # alternatively, login and password can be put within the JSON file's gate's dictionary structure.
Option 1. is interesting to make an executable embed and thus "hide" a login+password. Indeed, python "compilers" such as [http://www.py2exe.org/ Py2Exe] and [http://pyinstaller.python-hosting.com/ PyInstaller] most of the time provide the option to embed all imported modules into a single executable file.

*Language:* [http://www.python.org Python 2.5+]

*Libraries:*
  * [http://www.lag.net/paramiko/ paramiko]: a pure-python, cross-platform, sockets-based SSH2 implementation.
  * [http://docs.python.org/library/json.html simplejson]: a JSON parser and dumper. Renamed and made official under the name json from Python2.6.

*Downloads:*

The executables in the archive require nothing to run properly except your usual system libaries which you must have anyway.

_About python => executables packaging:_
The Windows binary executables were packaged with [http://www.py2exe.org/ Py2Exe] and the Linux ones with [http://pyinstaller.python-hosting.com/ PyInstaller]. Setup files for that are included within the [http://audiospread.googlecode.com/files/multi_tunneler_source.tar.gz source archive].
