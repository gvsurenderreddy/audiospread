#summary Notes on what we should undertake to have our final deliverables namely for the end-users

= Introduction =

The project is to release the following software-related deliverables likely at the beginning of April 2009:
  * installation instructions for radio stations IT staff
  * user documentation (content management, business management...)
  * Debian packages (or at least both Debian and Ubuntu compatible packages)
  * A Live & Installable Custom Distribution CD 


= Details =

== Project-specific Debian packages ==
  * Debian packages could be created with a graphical application [http://code.google.com/p/debianpackagemaker/ debianpackagemaker] or just from shell with the usual Debian tools with help from the web and IRC.

== A Live & Installable Custom Distribution CD ==
=== From an Ubuntu installation/distribution ===
  * To create a new CD with custom packages and settings (ie. change background image settings, logos, skins...): [http://reconstructor.aperantis.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1 Reconstructor, a python GUI helping to Build and customize graphically an Ubuntu-based library from any Ubuntu CD].
  * To create a new CD from an existing Ubuntu installation: [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomizationFromScratch from a help.ubuntu.com article with everything happening with shell commands to enter]. It's probably possible to change the default graphics with this method though it is not shown on the latter link.
