This wiki presents the way that our project should advance. 
= Introduction =

Each developer of each team: Drupal and Asterisk should see the project as a number of tasks
which have to correspond to *users stories*. 

For example:
"as a [some role], I want to [do some simple action]"

Each user story corresponds to one or several *developing tasks*.

Finally, each task has a *developing period*(hours).

*Bugs* can occur and must be resolved in an estimated number of hours.





= Cycle =

*Iterations of 10 days with the available number of workable hours according to our schedule.*

*A number of developers is assigned to this iteration*-> see tickets sent by each of the two teams managers (Wenyi: Drupal; me: Asterisk)to their developers.

  
*Inserting in each iteration user storie's tasks or bugs to resolve.*
