= Installing !AudioSpread on Ubuntu Linux =

*_IMPORTANT:_ For now, this page will be useless to you because we have not released any runnable files yet...)*

At the end of the project we should have very user-friendly tools to install the !AudioSpread server solution. For now here's some steps on installing the necessary packages on which !AudioSpread relies, as well as a way to plug !AudioSpread into those.

To install the *!AudioSpread server set*, a number of packages provided along with the Ubuntu distribution are necessary.

Those are :
===- A LAMP stack:===
You can type or select the respective packages with Synaptic (Ubuntu) or Adept (Kubuntu):
||sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-doc mysql-server php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql phpmyadmin||

OR paste this address into your Linux Web Browser:
||apt://apache2,apache2-doc,mysql-server,php5,libapache2-mod-php5,php5-mysql,phpmyadmin||

OR install [http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/xampp XAMPP] which ships as a single Ubuntu package and should be simpler to use though making you download unneeded packages.

===- Drupal (on top of a LAMP stack)===
Download a tar.gz archive of Drupal version 6.x and extract it into your Apache web folder (for example: /var/www/drupal/).

Drupal can be downloaded from [http://drupal.org/project/Drupal+project here.]

===- Asterisk, FreePBX, Trixbox===
Use the distributions packages or [http://colt45.chemlab.org/?p=55 see this blog link.]

===- The !AudioSpread files===
We haven't released anything for now.
