== Our hardware and software setup ==
For information, Interspread uses the following software tools to develop the AudioSpread solution:
  * On our custom server machine:
    * An [http://subversion.tigris.org SVN (or Subversion) server]
    * An [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP LAMP stack]: a [http://www.debian.org Debian-based] [http://www.ubuntu.org Ubuntu Linux] distribution running Apache, MySQL and PHP,
    * [http://www.drupal.org Drupal CMS,]
    * [http://www.asterisk.org Asterisk.]

  * On each developer and customer machine:
    * An [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Subversion_clients SVN client] (_for developers only_),
    * A SIP or H.323 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_VoIP_software#General_softphone_clients Voice-over-IP Softphone client,]
    * A Web Browser,
    * An [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_clients SSH client].

The SSH tunneling constraint comes from our server location and is not a requirement to get the same functionality as ours. Apart from that, having SSH access to the server may help for remote maintenance after initial setup.
The final end-user solution should see the communications ported from VoIP to regular phone technology. This however is out of the project scope for now.

This diagram below shows quickly how we plan to make a web app out of an SVN repository. Please refer to the info on the picture itself for credits (it was not done by us).

Below is a diagram of our deployment: we have posted a [http://audiospread.googlecode.com/files/Tools_Deployment_For_Development.dia Dia source file] of it in the [http://code.google.com/p/audiospread/downloads/list Downloads section].
