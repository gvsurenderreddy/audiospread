Our project methodology is being determined.
Just notes & links for now.
We are interesting in integrating RUP with some Agile development method.

One very page talks about that kind of integration:

This subsection is a citation from: http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/introductionToAM.htm

"Agile Modeling (AM) is a practice-based methodology for effective modeling and documentation of software-based systems.   Simply put, Agile Modeling (AM) is a collection of values, principles, and practices for modeling software that can be applied on a software development project in an effective and light-weight manner.  As you see in Figure 1 AM is meant to be tailored into other, full-fledged methodologies such as XP or RUP, enabling you to develop a software process which truly meets your needs. "

= TODO =
Decide on a precise methodology-mix and put that into the PTC.
Put things down with clear units (ie, nb of days of a cycle & cyle time structure & usual tasks). Make things clear as to where tickets are etc...
= About our Development Roadmap =
Our roadmap with milestones and tickets has been [http://code.google.com/p/audiospread/wiki/DevelopmentRoadmap on the Development Rodmap page] also reachable from the navigation panel. This is rather just a _development_ roadmap with only technical things to be done. Our full project has business & design things before, during and after development.

= Details =

No details for now.
